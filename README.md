A simple game where you are given a random quote from an anime character, and you are to guess the character that said the quote. The random quote is fetched from animechan's api. 
This project developed my understanding of handling API data and CORS as a whole, as I ran into CORS errors whilst trying to make my fetch requests - of which I solved through the use of a proxy server.
